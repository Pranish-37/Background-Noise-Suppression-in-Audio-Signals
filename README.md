# Background-Noise-Suppression-in-Audio-Signals
This project aims to enhance audio quality in communication systems by tackling the common problem of background noise. Our approach uses Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) estimation, and the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to deliver a real-time noise suppression solution.
